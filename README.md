Partner data validation for Louisiana. 
Data Partners: VEST and MGGG

The Redistricting Data Hub (RDH) repository to validate our data partners' precinct-level election result shapefiles. The scripts available in this repository are used to write the reports available at [redistrictrictingdatahub.org]([https://redistrictingdatahub.org/](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/)). 

We do not have the raw data sources available on this Github due to file constraints, but we are happy to share them if needed. 

Please reach out to info@redistrictingdatahub.org to reach our support team if you have any questions.
